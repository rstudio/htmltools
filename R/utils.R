# Implements a "whitespace eating" writer.
#
# WSTextWriter relies on the caller distinguishing between writes of important
# content, and writes of whitespace that may or may not be elided (`.$write()`
# vs `.$writeWS()`).
#
# At any point, `eatWS` may be called, which will cause any recent `writeWS`
# operations (i.e. those since either the beginning of time, or the most recent
# `write` operation) to be undone, AND for any future `writeWS` calls to be
# ignored. A call to `write` will be respected, and will restore normal
# behavior.
#
# Text is automatically converted to UTF-8 before being written.
#' @param bufferSize The initial size of the buffer in which writes are stored.
#'   The buffer will be periodically cleared, if possible, to cache the writes
#'   as a string. If the buffer cannot be cleared (because of the need to be
#'   able to backtrack to fulfill an `eatWS()` call), then the buffer size will
#'   be doubled.
