htmltools 0.3.6.9003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The `knit_print` methods are explicitly registered as S3 methods when both
  knitr and htmltools are loaded. This means that neither shiny nor htmltools
  need to be attached for the `knit_print` methods to work. (#108)

* Added some HTML tag functions to `tags` that were missing. (#111)

* Updated RcppExports for new version of Rcpp. (#93)

* `as.character.shiny.tags()` will handle non-ASCII attributes correctly if they
  are not encoded in native encoding.

* Fixed #99: `NA` attributes were sometimes rendered as `"NA"` in the HTML,
  instead of being blank. (#100)

* The error message for trailing commas in tag functions now provides context
  and useful information. (#109)

* Adds the ability to skip overwriting existing html dependencies in the function copyDependenciesToDir. Intended to be used with
rmarkdown::render to speed up rendering.


htmltools 0.3.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `validateCssUnit()` now accepts viewport units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax). (#56)

* `restorePreserveChunks()` marks the output with the correct encoding now
  (UTF-8).

* Length-0 attributes are now dropped, like NULLs. (#65)

* Fixed #69: On Windows, `renderDocument()` did not mark output as UTF-8 if the
  head was UTF-8 but body was ASCII. (#71)

htmltools 0.3.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `as.character` now returns a character vector with no other attributes.
  Previously it returned a character vector of class 'html'. (#31, #41)

* `htmlTemplate` now can use a string as a template instead of requiring a
  file. (#41, #43)

* HTML dependencies can now be added inline, instead of needing to use
  `attachDependencies()`. (#40, #42)

* `htmlDependency()` gained a new argument `all_files` to indicate whether all
  files under the src directory should be copied when rendering dependencies,
  or only those specified in the dependency objects. (#48)

* `copyDependencyToDir()` will always completely overwrite the target directory
  when copying HTML dependency files to make sure all dependency files are
  definitely updated in the target directory when the original dependency
  directory has been updated. In the past, the dependency files were not updated
  if they already existed. (#36)

* The version number in the directory name of an HTML dependency can be
  suppressed by setting options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE) when the
  dependency is copied via `copyDependencyToDir()`. (#37)

* Performance improvement rendering tags, by switching from `readLines` to
  `readChar`.

htmltools 0.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add `css` function for conveniently forming CSS declaration strings.

* Add template support, with the `htmlTemplate()`, `renderDocument()`, and
  `suppressDependencies()` functions.


htmltools 0.2.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add check that `htmlDependency()` isn't called with an absolute path when a
  binary package is built. (#22)

* Allow HTML content to include UTF-8, Latin1, and system encoded content. All
  will be converted to UTF-8 using enc2utf8() at render time. (#21)

* Add `tagGetAttribute()` and `tagHasAttribute()` functions.


htmltools 0.2.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add "append" parameter to attachDependencies, to allow adding dependencies,
  instead of replacing them.


htmltools 0.2.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add "attachment" parameter to htmlDependency, which can be used to allow any
  file in the dependency directory to be available via URL at runtime.


htmltools 0.2.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Explicit library(htmltools) is no longer required for tags to be rendered in
  knitr/rmarkdown documents.

* Added "viewer" parameter to html_print.


htmltools 0.2.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
